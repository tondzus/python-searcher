"Doctor in Charge" (1972) {The Minister's Health (#1.3)}
  
  PL: The Minister of Health is to be admitted for the removal of varicose veins.
  PL: When a vicar, Mr. Bridgenorth, also due to have varicose veins removed,
  PL: turns up slightly ahead of the minister, he is mistaken for the illustrious
  PL: patient and receives the full V.I.P. treatment whereas the minister himself
  PL: is treated rather more ordinarily. However the minister appreciates this,
  PL: and Professor Loftus breathes a sigh of relief that he might just get his
  PL: knighthood after all.
